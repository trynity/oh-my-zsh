Cool! Please have a look at the list below to understand how oh-my-zsh categorizes its issues.

Classification of issues and

- Bugs, which may be:
  - Specific of zsh \*
  - Regressions, in which we should summon the author of the offending commit once it is located

- Feature requests

- Helpdesk, which may be:
  - Specific of zsh \*
  - Everything else

\* In the case of bugs, I see the benefit in going through the trouble of responding to that. After all, oh-my-zsh should be the missing link that makes zsh perfect, and hunting down an upstream bug can lead to a submitted PR.
In the case of helpdesk, minimal response should be done. That is, provide a link to the wiki with the relevant information, or
add it to the FAQ of the wiki and point to it afterwards.
